# TODO: Write a short (1-3 paragraph) design document about your solution to Q4.
#       Please include the following:
#     
#         1) An explanation of what you wrote and how the ScriptPubKey works
#         2) Briefly, how the ScriptPubKey you wrote fits into the bigger 
#            picture of this atomic swap.
#         3) Consider the case of Alice sending coins to Bob with coinExchangeScript:
#            Why can Alice always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it? 
#            Why can't this be solved with a simple 1-of-2 multisig? 
#

1) I used the if statements that Bitcoin OP codes provided to make sure both conditions would pass.
Both scriptsigs push two values onto the stack and then the scriptpubkey duplicates and hashes the
top value. This hash is then compared to the hash of the secret value (hash_of_secret) using OP_EQUAL.
Depending on the value of this function, the script splits using an op_if statement. If the secret was
provided in the scriptsig, then the secret will be dropped from the stack, the public key will be
provided, and then checksig will be run. If the signatures of both parties was provided, then each
signature will be verified against their respective public key. In either case, the script will return
true when either scriptsig is provided.

2) In the bigger scope of the atomic swap, the scriptPubKey is used to lock the exchange amounts before
the swap occurs. When a swap is occurring, both parties use the scriptPubKey to move the money they are
swapping into a middle ground. Then, if the transaction either goes well or sour, the sender/recipient can
unlock those funds accordingly. This way there is a method to have the swap funds set in a middle ground 
before the swap is confirmed.

3) Because Alice gets Bob to sign her time-locked transaction, if Bob does not redeem the coins, they will
return back to Alice after the time expires. This way, if no coins are redeemed in the swap, both sets of
coins will return to their owners regardless. We cannot use a 1-of-2 multisig in this case because one
party could redeem their coins on one part of the swap and then use their signature to take back their
other coins that they put up for swapping.
